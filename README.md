# *What is this?*
  This is the **Maze Solver** application made by Saisha and Robert.

## *Purpose*
  The purpose of our project is for the program to solve a maze given the 2D-array representation, the user's intended start, and destination in an efficient manner.

## *Technical details*
  Two key java data structures we used were **Stacks** and **Queues**, which helped us implement DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search) respectively. We also used **Arrays, 2D-Arrays, LinkedLists, Lists, and ArrayLists** to store data as well.

## *Challenges*
  Some challenges we faced when programming our application was: the nature of the Java 2D-array and understanding its relationships between rows and columns. In the end, however, we overcame by seeking help, running the code on paper step by step, and using more time to correct the project.

## *How to use*
  You can use this program easily by cloning the source code via GitHub by clicking on **"Code"-"Local"**, then copying the link. Then open then IntelliJ IDE and open the burger menu icon: then click on **"Git"-"Clone"**, paste the URL link into the textField, then press **"Clone"**. After waiting for the download to finish, click **"Trust"** (we are student developers and will not put malware in your computer), and then double-click the **"MazeSolver.java"** with a triangle icon on the left menu. Last, hit the **green triangle** on the top-right of your IntelliJ window, and the program will run successfuly! Input the maze's text file's name if you changed it (default name is src/test.txt), making sure to include the path. Either do 1 or 2 (DFS or BFS) and the maze will be solved!
